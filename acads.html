        The 'academics' here is referred to as 'acads' by the campus junta. There are 8 semesters in total for BTech/BS
        courses. A semester is called a 'sem'. Every sem lasts about 4 months. But the period of 4 months seems like a
        torrent of 4 minutes. You
        are made to learn a lot of things in one go, with labs, quizzes, assignments, mid-sems (mid-semester exams),
        end-sems (end-semester exams), fests in
        between and various irresistible events. The FCH (First Course Handout) is generally released the night before
        the first class begins but sometimes, you don't get the FCH even if the classes of the particular course have
        already started. This is very annoying, especially when the time-table on Pingala shows that you have a class
        but the professor remains quiet about it <i class="fa-regular fa-face-frown"></i>

        The first year courses include basic stuff from almost all the departments. The curriculum starts with the EDT
        (English Diagnostic Test), which tests your level of English. This happens during the Orientation period. On the
        basis of this test, you are assigned an English course out of - Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. The test is
        conducted online and is very easy. People purposely make mistakes in the test so that they don't get the
        Advanced course. But I feel this is not good since you would then be wasting your time in the class (since
        attendance is important in this course and carries marks), learning nothing new. The entire batch
        gets divided into 2 groups, depending on their roll number, whether they are from the branch of Chemical
        Engineering and whether they are assigned the Basic English course. The half of the batch - people whose names
        start from 'A' to 'G'/'H', everyone from the Chemical branch and all those who have the Basic English course,
        get the following courses in the first semester :-

        <ol class="subs">
            <li> PHY111 : Physics Lab, a 3-credits course</li>
            <li> PHY112/PHY113/PHY114/PHY115 : Classical Dynamics/Electrodynamics/Quantum Mechanics/Oscillations and
                Waves, an 11-credits physics course, depending on your branch</li>
            <li> CHM112M : Physical Chemistry, a 4-credits course, till mid-sems</li>
            <li> CHM113M : Inorganic and Organic Chemistry, a 4-credits course, from after mid-sems till end-sems</li>
            <li> MTH111M : Single Variable Calculus, a 6-credits course, till mid-sems</li>
            <li> MTH112M : Application of Single Variable Calculus and Several Variable Calculus, a 6-credits course,
                from after mid-sems till end-sems</li>
            <li> ELC111/112/113 : English Language and Communication (Basic/Intermediate/Advanced), a 9-credits course
            </li>
            <li> TA111 : Engineering Graphics, a 9-credits course</li>
            <li> PE111 : Morning Exercise, a course with S/X grade</li>
        </ol>

        All the remaining students of the batch are allotted the following courses in the first semester :-

        <ol class="subs">
            <li> CHM111 : Chemistry Lab, a 3-credits course</li>
            <li> PHY112/PHY113/PHY114/PHY115 : Classical Dynamics/Electrodynamics/Quantum Mechanics/Oscillations and
                Waves, an 11-credits physics course, depending on your branch</li>
            <li> LIF111 : Introduction to Biology, a 6-credits course</li>
            <li> MTH111M : Single Variable Calculus, a 6-credits course, till mid-sems</li>
            <li> MTH112M : Application of Single Variable Calculus and Several Variable Calculus, a 6-credits course,
                from after mid-sems till end-sems</li>
            <li> ESC111M : Fundamentals of Computing-I, a 7-credits course, till mid-sems</li>
            <li> ESC112M : Fundamentals of Computing-II, a 7-credits course, from after mid-sems till end-sems</li>
            <li> ETH111 : Practical Ethics, a course with S/X grade</li>
            <li> PE111 : Morning Exercise, a course with S/X grade</li>
        </ol>

        In the second semester, the groups switch the courses, except the following changes :-

        <ol class="subs">
            <li> PE111 becomes PE112 - Evening Exercise, a course with S/X grade</li>
            <li> MTH111M becomes MTH113M - Linear Algebra, a 6-credits course, till mid-sems</li>
            <li> MTH112M becomes MTH114M - Ordinary Differential Equations, a 6-credits course, from after mid-sems till
                end-sems</li>
        </ol>

        Talking about the exams - they are no more objective! Even the quizzes are subjective! It's a bit tough in the
        beginning to get accustomed to
        the subjective pattern. The classes end around two days before the exam-week starts. Funny, isn't it? You hardly
        get any gap between the exam days. Sometimes, there are exams everyday. There can be multiple quizzes in a
        single day! In my first semester, on a Tuesday, I had 3 quizzes - PHY112, MTH112 and ESC112M, plus Chemistry lab
        and Ethics. At the end of that day, I felt so happy that I couldn't even sleep <i

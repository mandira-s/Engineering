                    <strong>2nd August, 2023 - The day of many emotions.</strong> It was raining heavily as I and my
                    parents
                    were heading towards the institute that JOSAA had awarded me. And then after being through the level
                    crossing, we saw the letters on the wall - INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY KANPUR, and the same
                    written in hindi on the other side. Then I realised, everything going on was true. During that time,
                    I wasn't happy that I got into some institute of national importance but I was extremely sad that my
                    parents would leave the place soon, without me. It was heartbreaking that I would be on my own from
                    then onwards, that I would have to use the new phone of mine to talk to them and that I wouldn't be
                    sleeping to my father's "Good night!" and waking up to my mother's "It's time to wake up!". We had
                    to wait at the checkpoints. Then, we headed to Hall-4 - the fresher-girls' hostel of IITK. That was
                    a long way from the main gates, giving us such a pleasant view of nature that I hadn't seen in my
                    life!

                    <strong>My shelter for the first year.</strong> So, as we entered the place, there was a lot of
                    hustle and bustle going on. New cycles, mattresses, tables, buckets... There was a huge gathering -
                    vendors, insurance agents, confused families, sad girls, happy girls, girls with ID-cards around
                    their necks, who looked the calmest of all and dogs, who were habituated with the chaos going on. I
                    called my Student Guide (who would later introduce herself as my 'Amma'). She took me and 5 other
                    girls to the hall office for the room allocation. There was a lot of paper work and
                    digital work done after getting into the single-room-turned-double-room. We got introduced to the
                    Pingala website which
                    would be our asset for the 4 years. We got into the mess for lunch. I don't remember the menu which
                    was served on that day but
                    the quality of food was good. When it was around 8pm, my parents had to leave. Not just mine but
                    every girl's family had to leave by 8pm. It was the rule. It was the saddest moment of my life. Me
                    and my parents were in tears, with my SG (Student Guide) consoling us in every way she could. That
                    night, I had to sleep in an unfamiliar place, on an unfamiliar bed with an unfamiliar girl in the
                    room. I knew that I couldn't escape to my parents' arms anymore if I felt bad in any sense. I don't
                    even remember if I had slept that night or not. That night, I was tired. My mind couldn't process
                    the flurry of things that had happened till then. And there was a lot more to come...

                    <strong>Getting introduced...</strong> From the next day onwards, it was our
                    orientation, where they take you throughout the campus and give you lots of important
                    information in one go that you can hardly understand. Of course, some people did but I,
                    personally, didn't feel I was getting it. We were taken to the places in long queues with our Ammas
                    shouting at us to run, else, we'll miss the show. The roads were clean, which is always a rare sight
                    in Delhi. The hot and humid weather was boring. We were taken to the auditorium. There were students from all over India.
                    There were different sorts of things going on the stage - speeches by the
                    important people, club orientations and showcase of talents. We had a bus ride within the campus to
                    get aquainted with the places. It was like a whirlpool for me. The airstrip is fascinating but the
                    story that they recite there was eerie. The sky-photo at the end was the prettiest part of the
                    orientation. With so much of success stories in the air and the feel of "You are in a world of
                    fantasy where every dream of yours comes true..." that everyone (other than the freshers) gives you,
                    you feel that in the 4 years to come, you will be the person you had always dreamed to be and maybe
                    more.

                    <strong>"IITK ka tempo high hai!"</strong> As soon as the families leave, you are introduced to some
                    of the IITK's culture. Rest, you learn as the days pass by. Me? I am still learning! There is a
                    family culture in IITK where a sophomore is appointed an SG who is in-charge of 5-6 freshers. In
                    females, the SG is called 'Amma' and the freshers under her are her 'Bachchiyaan', who among
                    themselves
                    are 'Behenein'. In males, the SG is called 'Bapu', the juniors 'Bachchein' and they are 'Bhai' to
                    each other. Similarly, you have 'Nani'/'Dada', 'Mausi'/'Chacha' etc. From the beginning of
                    orientation, they teach you some slogans like - 'IITK ka tempo high
                    hai!', 'Hall 4 ka tempo high hai!', 'Y23 ka tempo high hai!' etc., depending on whom or what you
                    want to glorify, 'Ek do, ek do; Core Team ko fek do!' and so on. You also get to learn some IITK
                    lingo like Chaapu, Maggu, BT, Dassa
                    to name a few. The most popular phrase that you would hear is 'Chill hai!', no matter how insane the
                    situation is! You can think this phrase to be equivalent to 'All is well!' from 3 Idiots <i

                    start for my first class of IIT life, I was lucky enough to get a friend who accompanied me. I was
                    never a pro in using Google Maps. I would get lost in the campus in my hunt for labs or other
                    venues. It took me much longer to memorise the directions than my batchmates. 1055-acres land looks
                    crazier than it sounds, at least when you get lost having nobody with you. Honestly, there were
                    situations, when I avoided events just because I didn't know the location! Of course, people help
                    you but at one point, you would want to do it on your own. You know, I have discovered some amazing
                    routes myself. And it was really fun!

                    the topper in their school. In an IIT, your competition is with other IITians - the toppers from all
                    across the country! The academics here is, to be honest, tough. With too many courses to master
                    simultaneously in a very short time with a grading that isn't satisfactory, the academics is tough.
                    You have labs, quizzes, mid-sems, end-sems and assignments. That really is a lot! The course stuff
                    is hard to understand but if you have studied thoroughly for olympiads, JSTSE, NTSE, KVPY, JEE etc.
                    before coming to this place, you can easily master the courses here.

                    to ensure that the campus is safe and secure. The labs are of course counted in the list of the best
                    ones in India. The library is huge. There are clubs for every kind of field you can imagine. The
                    campus offers sports of every kind. There
                    are eateries and parks
                    and shops that have almost everything that you would require for your entire stay. The Counselling
                    Service is also amazing. It really guides you in the best possible manner and tries to solve
                    whatever problem you face. In terms of facilities, I think IITK is phenomenal.

                    knowing how talented people can be! You would also meet people who don't match your taste and you
                    might not like them but again, there are people who become your best friends! I have met some
                    amazing people here, who have enriched my experience here in some way or the other.

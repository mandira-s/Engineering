                    IITK offers a variety of sports. From athletics, wall-climbing, cricket to chess, skating, shooting
                    and more, the sports in IITK has you engaged! In the first year, under the PE courses, you get to
                    opt between CPA (Compulsory Physical Activity) and CCA (Compulsory Cultural Activity). If you get
                    CPA, you have to do one sport twice a week. Under CCA, you have dance, music, fine arts and
                    dramatics.
                    There is NSS (National Service Scheme) too. NCC (National Cadet Corps) is open to the boys only. In
                    CPA and CCA, you get to discover your hidden talents and also enjoy your hobbies. There are student
                    clubs under MnC (Media and Culture) that include the Fine Arts Club, the Dance Club, the Music Club,
                    Fursat Mandli or the Dramatics Club, the Film Club etc. If you love English, you can get into the
                    English Literary Society. If you love Hindi, there's the Hindi Sahitya Sabha. Are you interested in
                    comedy? Welcome to the Humour House! A beatbox lover? You will enjoy yourself in the Hip-Hop
                    Collective! If you enjoy journalism, there's Vox Populi. If you want to learn entrepreneurship,
                    there's the E-Cell (Entrepreneurship Cell). And
                    there are a lot more. Under the SnT (Science and Technology), you have the Robotics Club, the
                    Programming Club, the Astronomy Club, the Electronics club etc. There are societies like the BCS
                    (Brain and Cognitive Society) that teach AI and ML and stuff. There's Speedcubing Club, Anime
                    Society,
                    Photography Club, Book Club... the list goes on and on and on. The newest group founded is the
                    Meraki Society - dedicated to culinary arts! So, as you can see, there are clubs devoted to every
                    possible interest and if you think your kinda club is missing, you can start it yourself!

                    IITK conducts three major fests - Udghosh (the sports fest), Antaragni (the cultural fest) and
                    Techkriti (the tech fest). During these, the campus is very beautifully decorated and it is full of
                    life! Great personalities visit the campus. The best part of the fests is the concert by some great
                    singer. Besides, there are events like the E-Summit (by the E-Cell) and many other by the clubs.
                    There are inter-hall events too like Takneek (the tech competition), Inferno (the sports
                    competition) and Galaxy (the cultural competition). The Freshers' Nite is the first event of every
                    student here, where freshers showcase their talents under the clubs of IITK.

                    The stores keep rakhis for Rakshabandhan, decorations for Diwali, colours for Holi and what not?!
                    You can get items for birthday celebrations too, making every special event a blissful memory!

                    if

                    (which is close to the huge scenic fountain in front of the library), a beautiful park called
                    'Park-67', which is contributed to the campus by the batch of 1967 and the Airstrip.

                    your problem. They will take care of the rest of the things. There is an Apollo pharmacy in the same

                    Of course, nothing is perfect in the world and so is IITK. There are some things that I hate here.
                    One of them is the rain. The rains are beautiful here - the greenery that springs up, the peacocks
                    and the birds are beautiful to behold. But some areas get so waterlogged that you just hate it! In
                    some places the roads are poorly built like those around Hall-4 and the OAT. The
                    campus lags in providing internet connectivity in every corner. I mean, I was really frustrated when
                    my phone showed me that I was offline when I was in search of my friend in an event in the Pronite
                    Ground. My UPI didn't work there when I went to the food stalls and I didn't have any cash with me.
                    The network is poor in the shopping areas, too. Sometimes, the prices are high. Sometimes, you have
                    to hunt for food in festivals like Diwali and Holi when no mess and no canteen is open and almost
                    every eatery is closed. The academics' load is sometimes very hectic and a bit too much to handle.
                    Not everyone is born a Matilda Wormwood. Again, since nothing is perfect in the world, we can't expect this institute to
                    be one. But I still hope that things will get better as the days go by...

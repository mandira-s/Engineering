    <div id="content1">
        Hostel life is not as comfortable as at home, but it isn't that bad. In first year, the girls here are
        made to stay in Hall-4 (short for Hall of Residence-4). Hall-4 houses both UG and PG girls. From second year
        onwards, the girls stay in Hall-6. In Hall-4, you have to share a room with another girl as a UG. The rooms look
        as if they are made for single occupancy - there is one almirah, one table, one chair, two beds in a very
        congested area. The mess is good. The food is hygeinic (or so it seems). The menu is a mixture of cuisines from
        the entire country but the taste isn't that supreme. There is a washing room for your clothes that charges Rs 5
        for a bucket of clothes, a canteen that is admired by everyone in the campus but is a bit expensive as compared
        to the mess, a study room which is frequented by dogs, a badminton court etc. So, you see, Hall-4 has almost
        everything you need. There is a tailor shop, a beauty parlour and a general store, too! There are guest rooms
        for your family members that can be used on terms of advanced booking. There are cleaning ladies for cleanliness
        of the hostel. You can ask them to clean your rooms. They are very sweet and helpful.

    <div id="content2">
        In my first year, we were spread among blocks - E, E1 and F. Each block has three floors. There are water coolers
        in every block and in front of the mess. There is a huge number
        of trees and a garden near the front gate. You can hear the peacocks' and the other birds' calls and their sight
        is just indescribable!
        Hall-4 is quite close to the PE grounds, the OAT, the shopping area, the fuit vendors', the Health Centre,
        Hall-6
        and the academic area. Hall-4 is one of the oldest hostels of IITK and used to house boys in the past. It is one
        of the prettiest halls of the campus and once you get there, you can't stop yourself from shouting <br>
        <strong><i>'Hall-4 ka tempo high hai!'</i></strong>
    </div>

    <div id="content3">
        The fresher boys are made to stay in Hall-13, in double and triple-sharing rooms. They too have a mess and a
        canteen and many more. The senior boys stay in different halls - 5, 12 etc. The best thing about every hostel in
        the campus is the security. IITK ensures that you are safe in the campus!
